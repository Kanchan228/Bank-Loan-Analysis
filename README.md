# Bank Loan Report | Data Analytics Project (SQL + Excel)

This project analyzes a bank’s lending portfolio using **SQL for data extraction and KPI calculations** and **Excel for interactive dashboarding and reporting**. The goal is to evaluate lending performance, assess credit risk, and derive actionable insights to support data-driven banking decisions.

## Objective
- Monitor overall loan performance and portfolio health  
- Distinguish between **Good Loans** and **Bad Loans** based on loan status  
- Analyze borrower behavior and risk using metrics like **DTI, interest rate, and credit grade**  
- Identify trends across time, geography, loan purpose, and borrower profiles  

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data extraction, transformation, KPI calculations (MTD & MoM)  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data modeling, pivot tables, charts, and interactive dashboards  

## Key KPIs
- Total loan applications  
- Total funded amount  
- Total amount received  
- Average interest rate  
- Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio  
- Good vs Bad loan distribution  

## Analysis Highlights
- Loan volatility increases as credit grades decline, indicating higher risk  
- Home improvement loans increased through mid-year before declining  
- Education loans in lower credit grades show relatively higher DTI  
- Majority of borrowers prefer **60-month loan terms**  
- Good loans recover a significantly higher portion of funded amounts compared to bad loans  
- Small business loans exhibit the highest bad loan rate, signaling elevated risk  

## Dashboard Features
- Time-based analysis (monthly trends, MTD & MoM)  
- State-wise loan distribution  
- Loan term and purpose analysis  
- Employment length and home ownership insights  
- Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering  

## Key Learnings
- Hands-on understanding of banking and lending domain metrics  
- Practical experience in credit risk and portfolio analysis  
- Strengthened skills in SQL querying, Excel dashboarding, and data storytelling  

## Summary
This project demonstrates how **SQL + Excel** can deliver **robust, business-ready BI solutions** commonly used in banking and financial services.
